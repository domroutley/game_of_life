# TPS optimised Game of life

This repository serves to contain my attempts to run a [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulation in multiple different languages.

Each optimised for speed (measured in game Ticks Per Second), the timer starting at program runtime and ending at the detection of a loop (where the game board is no longer "new").

## Languages I intent to try this in

| Language | Complete | Link to code | Average TPS (3 runs) |
|---       |---       |---           |---|
| C        | Yes      | [code](./c/game_of_life.c) | 4897 |
| C++      | No       |              |  |
| C#       | No       |              |  |
| Node.js  | No       |              |  |
| Python3  | No       |              |  |
| Java     | No       |              |  |
| Go       | No       |              |  |
